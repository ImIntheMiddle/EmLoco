## üìëAbstract
*Humans can predict future human trajectories even from momentary observations by using human pose-related cues. However, previous **Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP)** methods leverage the pose cues implicitly, resulting in implausible predictions. To address this, we propose **Locomotion Embodiment**, a framework that explicitly evaluates the physical plausibility of the predicted trajectory by locomotion generation under the laws of physics. While the plausibility of locomotion is learned with an indifferentiable physics simulator, it is replaced by our differentiable **Locomotion Value function** to train an HTP network in a data-driven manner. In particular, our proposed **Embodied Locomotion loss** is beneficial for efficiently training a stochastic HTP network using multiple heads. Furthermore, the **Locomotion Value filter** is proposed to filter out implausible trajectories at inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method further enhances even the state-of-the-art HTP methods across diverse datasets and problem settings.*
